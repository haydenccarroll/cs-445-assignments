some mysteries:
    1. why is arrayops saying Array is unindexed array on line 22 but not 21.
    2. what is the deal with main being defined. what is the exact logic? seems like 
        strange and emptyline contradict. I have working solution though.

errors:
    arglist error if cant open file.
    never actually did -P printing.
        make const print type
        make all operators print their type
