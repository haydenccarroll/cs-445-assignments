some mysteries:
    1. why is arrayops saying Array is unindexed array on line 22 but not 21.
    2. what is the deal with main being defined. what is the exact logic? seems like 
        strange and emptyline contradict. I have working solution though.

stuff to add to hw4:
    DONE Cannot have a break statement outside of loop.
    DONE Cannot use array as test condition in % statement
    DONE Cannot use array in position &d in range of for statement.
    DONE Expecting x in parameter x of call to x declared on line x but got x
    DONE Expecting x in position d in range of for statement but got x
    DONE Expecting array in parameter x of call to x declared on line x
    DONE Not expecting array in parameter x of call to x declared on line x
    DONE Expecting Boolean test condition in x statement but got x
    DONE Function x at line x is expecting no return value, but return has a value
    DONE Function x at line x is expecting to return but return has no value
    DONE Function x at line x is expecting to return x but returns x

    Initializer for variable x is not a constant expression
    Initializer for variable x of x is of x
    Initializer for variable x requires both operands be arrays or not but variable isx am array and rhs isx an array
    Too few parameters passed for function x declared on line x
    Too many parameters passed for function x declared on line x
    WARN Expecting to return x but function has no return statement
    WARN the function x seems not to be used
    WARN the variable x seems not to be used
