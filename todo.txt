some mysteries:
    1. why is arrayops saying Array is unindexed array on line 22 but not 21.
    2. what is the deal with main being defined. what is the exact logic? seems like 
        strange and emptyline contradict. I have working solution though.
    3. why is variable c uninitialized for arrayops ln 45
