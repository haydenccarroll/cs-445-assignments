THE WRONG LIST:

    seems like subscopes still contribute to the outer most scope offset. 
    for reference, see exampleScope.diff ln 6

    it seems as if for loop variables arent getting used in the size calculation.
    maybe because they arent a decl? not quite sure. actually pretty sure its because they dont have size.
    See break3.diff ln5 for reference.

    


    
    we arent printing static when we should.

    we arent checking to see if a variable is static. 
    
    seems like some global variables are out of order. maybe string constants go first in memory?
        or maybe stuff that has = or :, the right side should get processed first.
        ex: a2a.diff
