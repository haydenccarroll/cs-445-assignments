THE WRONG LIST:
    seems like most global and local mem: stuff is off by 1.
    we dont handle parameter arrays good, because they dont have a specified size. they should default to size 1.
    it seems as if for loop variables dont have a size when used inside the loop. same story probably.
    we arent printing static when we should.
