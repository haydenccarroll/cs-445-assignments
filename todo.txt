fix a variety of printing issues (should be fairly simple)
    1. I print but got of type bool, etc. i dont want this. there is a flag to remove of.
add the uninitialized warning checks

some specifics
in cover.c-:
    the cannot index nonarray have a diff, but i dont know why.
    they seem identical, maybe the python sort isnt working as intended.
in allbad.c:
    the operation ? does not work with arrays (i do not print this, i should)

    ln 65 = (i erroneuopsulyt print out = reuquires operands of the same type but lhs is is array of type int)
    ln 55 = i have some printing issues (nothing major)
    ln 52 and 53 symbol z is already declared (they dont have this)
    ln 44 array 'ca' should be indexed by type int but got is array of type bool (should just be type bool)
