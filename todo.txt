cleanup (obviously)

ass (=) isnt right i dont think for initialization purposes
    , especially with arrays.


ERROR(LINKER) in strange.c- that i dont have. i think because it shouldnt have args.

in allbad.c:
    the operation ? does not work with arrays (i do not print this, i should)

    ln 65 = (i erroneuopsulyt print out = reuquires operands of the same type but lhs is is array of type int)
    ln 55 = i have some printing issues (nothing major)
    ln 52 and 53 symbol z is already declared (they dont have this)
    ln 44 array 'ca' should be indexed by type int but got is array of type bool (should just be type bool)
