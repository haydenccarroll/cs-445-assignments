THE WRONG LIST:
    it seems as if for loop variables dont have a size when used inside the loop. same story probably.
    
    we arent printing static when we should.

    we arent checking to see if a variable is static. 
    
    seems like some global variables are out of order. maybe string constants go first in memory?
        or maybe stuff that has = or :, the right side should get processed first.
        ex: a2a.diff
    
    when calculating the size of a function, we need to also check parameters siblings.
    its possible in thecase of int a, b, char c, that the b will not get seen.
