line 218 in new_c-.y has some differences.
it has stmt -> closed and open stmt, which is not in the official grammar.
its possible that this is where the danging else ambiguity is solved.

line 238 also has this, where the curly braces are called BGN and END instead.

line 274 is also different.

why is typespec not part of tokenData
